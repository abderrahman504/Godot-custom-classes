A project for custom classes I made for Godot 4


## Drawer Container
A container that you place at the edge of a parent control and acts like a drawer.
Allows to specify which direction the drawer opens to and if it opens to enter the parent boundries or exit them.

## Region Marker 2D
A class that marks a rectangle area in the editor. It serves a similar purpose as ```Marker2D``` and ```Marker3D``` but for rectangles instead of points.
